A vanilla combat minigame where you design and sail your own raft. Works for singleplayer and multiplayer.

Design a raft to battle against each other in FFA and TEAM modes, or band together to defeat the fearsome pirate Captain Coldblood. Four arenas to play in. For 1 to 12 players. 

If playing on multiplayer: 
1. Make sure everyone gets the resource pack: http://rebrand.ly/RaftClash2RP 
2. Change enable-command-block to true in server.properties, or the map will not work 
3. Change allow-flight to true in server.properties, or people will get kicked when on a raft
